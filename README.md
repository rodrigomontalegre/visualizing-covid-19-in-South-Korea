# Visualizing COVID 19 Data in South Korea

## Project description
This case study is part of the university course "Data Visualization and Analysis in R". The goal of the case study is to indentify interesting relationships in the data, formulate hypotheses and to test these. The case study focuses on COVID-19 cases in South Korea from January 2020 to July 2020. The datasets were provided to us students. However, we were allowed to add additional data if needed to pursure a deeper or more specific analysis. The datasets made available to us contained cases numbers, anonymised patient information, information on policy, regions, search trends, floating  and weather. Each group was made up of four university students.

## Important considerations for the final analysis

- At least three claims were formulated and communicated well
- All stated claims were supported by appropriate figures (appropriate plot types were used and associative plots supported each claim)
- Alternative interpretations of the associations were discussed (directionality, effect of a third variable, robustness, etc.)
- At least two claims were additionally supported by an appropriate statistical test
- At least one example was shown, where controlling for the effect of a third variable was necessary to support a claim to to invalidate a perviously stated claim

## Additional considerations for the Rmd report with the entire analysis

- And Rmd report has to be created that runs and created all figures in the final presenation
- The report is cleaned-up
- The report is stand-alone. Only the report is needed to understand the performed analysis. It should contain explanations/interpretations and code.

## Outside datasets integrated into the project

- Population, Households and Housing Units from the Korean Statistical Information Service (https://kosis.kr/eng/statisticsList/statisticsListIndex.do?menuId=M_01_01&vwcd=MT_ETITLE&parmTabId=M_01_01&statId=1962001&themaId=#SelectStatsBoxDiv)

- Population density by population census frmo the Korean Statistical Information Serivce (https://kosis.kr/eng/statisticsList/statisticsListIndex.do?menuId=M_01_01&vwcd=MT_ETITLE&parmTabId=M_01_01#SelectStatsBoxDiv)
