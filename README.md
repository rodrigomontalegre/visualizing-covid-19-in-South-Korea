# Visualizing COVID 19 Data in South Korea

## Project description
This case study is part of the university course "Data Visualization and Analysis in R". The goal of the case study is to indentify interesting relationships in the data, formulate hypotheses and to test these. The case study focuses on COVID-19 cases in South Korea from January 2020 to July 2020. The datasets were provided to us students. However, we were allowed to add additional data if needed to pursure a deeper or more specific analysis. The datasets made available to us contained cases numbers, anonymised patient information, information on policy, regions, search trends, floating  and weather. Each group was made up of four university students.
